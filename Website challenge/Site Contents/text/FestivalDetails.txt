# Festival Description:
Words on the Water is a festival where contemporary writers and readers meet in a beautiful west coast setting. Friday evening offers a stimulating mediated panel discussion and a brief glimpse at all of our writers. On Saturday you can attend individual annotated readings with each guest author. Sessions are 45 minutes and writers often allow time for questions. The Literary Cabaret on Saturday provides all the components necessary for an entertaining and stimulating evening: readings, music, and good food. Socializing with the writers and other like-minded readers is a key rewarding element of the festival. All weekend books by our featured writers will be on display and available for purchase. The venue, Campbell River's Maritime Heritage Centre, provides a perfect nautical backdrop for this event.
