      What is Words on the Water?
    </h1>
      <p>
        Words on the Water is a festival where
        contemporary writers and readers meet in
        a beautiful west coast setting. Friday
        evening offers a stimulating mediated panel
        discussion and a brief glimpse at all of our
        writers. On Saturday you can attend individual
        annotated readings with each guest author.
        Sessions are 45 minutes and writers often
        allow time for questions. The Literary Cabaret
        on Saturday provides all the components
        necessary for an entertaining and stimulating
        evening: readings, music, and good food.
        Socializing with the writers and other
        like-minded readers is a key rewarding
        element of the festival. All weekend books
        by our featured writers will be on display
        and available for purchase. The venue,
        Campbell River's Maritime Heritage Centre,
        provides a perfect nautical backdrop for this
        event.
