          <h1>About Words on the Water</h1>
          <p>Words on the Water is a festival where
            contemporary writers and readers meet in
            a beautiful west coast setting. Friday
            evening offers a stimulating mediated panel
            discussion and a brief glimpse at all of our
            writers. On Saturday you can attend individual
            annotated readings with each guest author.
            Sessions are 45 minutes and writers often
            allow time for questions. The Literary Cabaret
            on Saturday provides all the components
            necessary for an entertaining and stimulating
            evening: readings, music, and good food.
            Socializing with the writers and other
            like-minded readers is a key rewarding
            element of the festival. All weekend books
            by our featured writers will be on display
            and available for purchase. The venue,
            Campbell River's Maritime Heritage Centre,
            provides a perfect nautical backdrop for this
            event.
